# ansible-ssh

**ansible-ssh** is a command-line utility that connects to a host using connection variables retrieved from an Ansible inventory file.  
It leverages Ansibleâ€™s inventory system to extract connection details (such as host, port, user, key, and even password) and then invokes SSH with the proper parameters.  
It supports extra SSH options via `ansible_ssh_common_args` and `ansible_ssh_extra_args` (*still experimental and not working properly*) and can generate a bash completion script for convenience.

## Features

`ansible-ssh -i inventory host`

- **Automated Connection Parameters:** Extracts connection details from an Ansible inventory.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Uses standard SSH configuration (e.g., `~/.ssh/config`) for any unspecified settings.
- **Extra SSH Options:** Incorporates additional SSH arguments defined in your inventory. (disabled for now)
- **Bash Completion:** Generates a bash completion script that auto-completes host names based on your inventory.

## Requirements

- **Python3**
- **Ansible:** For running `ansible-inventory`.
- **sshpass:** (Optional) Required for password-based SSH connections.
- **bash-completion:** This is pretty much 50% of the functionality.
- **jq:** Required for parsing JSON output in the bash completion script.


## Installation

Clone the repository, link/copy somewhere into $PATH, and install bash completion script. Make it executable and most likely rerun bash to load completion script.
```bash
git clone https://your.repo.url/ansible-ssh.git
cd ansible-ssh
chmod +x ansible-ssh.py

ln -s ansible-ssh.py ~/.local/bin/ansible-ssh

ansible-ssh -C bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/ansible-ssh
```

**On Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 ansible-core sshpass jq bash-completion -y
```
**On RHEL/CentOS:**
```bash
sudo yum install python3 ansible-core sshpass jq bash-completion -y
```

## Usage
```bash
$ ansible-ssh --help
usage: ansible-ssh [-h] [-C {bash}] [-i INVENTORY] [host]

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C {bash}, --complete {bash}
                        Print bash completion script and exit
  -i INVENTORY, --inventory INVENTORY
                        Path to the Ansible inventory file
